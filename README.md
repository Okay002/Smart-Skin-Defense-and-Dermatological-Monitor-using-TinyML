## 📦Hardware Setup
This project uses the following components:
ESP32 Microcontroller:The ESP32 is connected to a breadboard, where it will handle communication and data processing.

DHT22 Sensor:This is a temperature and humidity sensor. The sensor's connections are as follows:

VCC (Power) connected to the 3V pin of the ESP32.
GND (Ground) connected to the GND pin of the ESP32.
Data connected to a GPIO pin (as indicated by the blue wire in the image).

UV Sensor: The UV sensor, likely to measure UV radiation, has the following connections:

VCC connected to the 3V pin of the ESP32.
GND connected to the GND pin of the ESP32.
Data connected to a GPIO pin (as shown by the yellow wire).

Connections:
Ensure that the VCC pins of the DHT22 sensor and the UV sensor are connected to the 3V output of the ESP32.
GND pins from both sensors should be connected to the ground of the ESP32.
The data pins of the sensors are connected to appropriate GPIO pins on the ESP32, as shown in the diagram.
